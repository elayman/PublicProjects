The detectGestures function was where most of the calculation code is located,
my team and I decided to calibrate the user's arm length by taking samples of depth
measurements via the kinect every 15 time steps and normalizing over those measurements.
We then normalized the sensor data to wheel speed so that a percentage of your arm
extension mapped to a percentage of the robot's wheel speed. After testing, we created a larger range for 0 wheel speed because it was too difficult to get accurate sensor
readings and difficult to hold your arms steady when you want the robot to stop.

We did similar calculations when adding the robot's claw movement/functionality.

UserTrackerApplication.java just sets up the onscreen display of the user and begins
the UserTracker code.

BluetoothConnection.java sets up a bluetooth connection between the host computer
and the NXT robot using a java library called blue cove.
